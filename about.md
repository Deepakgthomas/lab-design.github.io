The Laboratory for Software Design at Iowa State University conducts research in
programming languages, compilers and software engineering.

Our overarching goal is to develop tools and techniques that enable better
design of software intensive systems: a better design that is easier and cheaper
to implement, verify and sustain and that is more portable across computing
platform differences.

Our three leading projects are <a href="http://paninij.org">**Panini**</a>, a
language designed to enable safe and efficient concurrent programming by
construction, <a href="http://boa.cs.iastate.edu">**Boa**</a>, a domain-specific
language and infrastructure for mining software repositories, and <a
href="http://ptolemy.cs.iastate.edu">**Ptolemy**</a>, a language that strives to
balance expressiveness and modular reasoning for crosscutting concerns.

Our research meetings are in 216 Atanasoff Hall on Wednesdays from 9am-1pm.
