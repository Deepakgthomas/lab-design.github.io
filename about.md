The laboratory for software design at Iowa State University conducts research in
programming languages, compilers and software engineering. Our overarching goal
is to develop tools and techniques that enable better design of software
intensive systems: a better design that is easier and cheaper to implement,
verify and sustain and that is more portable across computing platform
differences.

Our two leading projects are Panini that aims to enable safe and efficient
concurrent programming by construction, and Boa that is a domain-specific
language and an infrastructure for mining software repositories.

Our research meetings are in 216 Atanasoff Hall on Wednesdays from 9a.m.-1p.m.
