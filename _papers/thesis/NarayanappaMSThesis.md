title: Monitoring software using property-aware program sampling
abstract: >
  Monitoring or profiling programs provides us with an understanding for its
  further improvement and analysis. Typically, for monitoring or profiling, the
  program is instrumented to execute additional code that collects necessary
  data. A problem is that program instrumentation is often reported to cause
  between 10% and 390% time and space overhead. A number of techniques based on
  statistical sampling have been proposed to reduce the instrumentation
  overhead. Statistical sampling based instrumentation techniques, although
  effective in reducing the overall overhead, often lead to poor coverage or
  less accurate results. In this work, we present a profiling technique based on
  property-aware program sampling. The key ideas are (i) to use program slicing
  to narrow down the scope of instrumentation to the sections of program
  relevant to the property of interest, (ii) to decompose large program slices
  into logically related slice fragments, and (iii) to apply statistical
  sampling on the set of slice fragments.
