title: Model Programs for Preserving Composite Invariants
abstract: >
  We describe a solution for the SAVCBS challenge problem: a technique for
  specifying and verifying invariants for objects designed using the Composite
  design pattern. The solution presents a grey-box speciﬁcation technique using
  JML’s model program feature. We show that model program speciﬁcations function
  as exemplars for capturing helper method calls in a way that preserves
  modularity and encapsulation.
