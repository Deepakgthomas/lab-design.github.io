title: A Preliminary Study of Quantified, Typed Events
abstract: >
  In previous work, Rajan and Leavens presented the design of Ptolemy,
  a language which incorporates the notion of quantified, typed events for
  improved separation of concerns. In this work, we present an empirical study
  to evaluate the effectiveness of Ptolemy's design by applying it to a series
  of architectural releases of a software product line (SPL) for handling
  multimedia on mobile devices, called MobileMedia, and the comparison and
  contrast of our findings with a previous in-depth analysis by Figueiredo et
  al of the object-oriented and aspect-oriented designs of the same system. Our
  comparative analysis using quantitative metrics proposed by Chidambar and
  Kemerer (and subsequently used by Garcia et al) and a net-options value
  analysis used earlier by Cai, Sullivan and Lopes shows that quantified, typed
  events significantly improve the separation of concerns and further decouple
  components in the MobileMedia design.
