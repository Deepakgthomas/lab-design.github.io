title: "Nu: Towards an Aspect-Oriented Invocation Mechanism"
abstract: >
  The contribution of this work is the design, implementation and evaluation of
  a new aspect-oriented invocation mechanism for preserving design modularity in
  object code. We call our mechanism Bind. We make three basic claims. First, it
  is feasible to realize a programming model that supports Bind to preserve
  design modularity in object code. Second, the new invocation mechanism further
  improves the conceptual integrity of the aspect-oriented programming models by
  allowing advising and runtime properties of aspect-like constructs to be
  modeled as simple combinations of invocation primitives as opposed to new
  language constructs. Third, it brings new possibility for structuring
  aspect-oriented systems, removing the commitment to a single aspect-language
  model, and expanding the program design space to include arbitrary
  combinations of language models and advising structures. To support these
  claims, we present the design and implementation of Nu, a programming model
  based on the .NET Framework that supports Bind as an invocation mechanism. We
  show that Nu supports aspect-oriented program designs where multiple
  aspect-language models can be emulated using Bind, and used in arbitrary
  combinations without compromising the design modularity in the object code.
