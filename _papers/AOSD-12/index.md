title: An Exploratory Study of the Design Impact of Language Features for Aspect-oriented Interfaces
abstract: >
  A variety of language features to modularize crosscutting concerns have
  recently been discussed, e.g. open modules, annotation-based pointcuts,
  explicit join points, and quantified-typed events. All of these ideas are
  essentially a form of aspect-oriented interface between object-oriented and
  crosscutting modules, but the representation of this interface differs. While
  previous works have studied maintenance of AO programs versus OO programs, an
  empirical comparison of different AO interfaces to each other to investigate
  their benefits has not been performed. The main contribution of this work is a
  rigorous empirical study that evaluates the effectiveness of these proposals
  for AO interfaces towards software maintenance by applying them to 35
  different releases of a software product line called MobileMedia and 50
  different releases of a web application called Health Watcher. Our comparative
  analysis using quantitative metrics proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer shows
  the strengths and weaknesses of these AO interface proposals. Our change
  impact analysis shows the design stability provided by each of these recent
  proposals for AO interfaces.
