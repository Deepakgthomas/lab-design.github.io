title: "Task Fusion: Improving Utilization of Multi-User Clusters"
abstract: >
  Researchers use shared computing clusters to ask interesting questions and
  wish to maximize their utilization. Currently, optimizations focus on
  individual programs. We present task fusion to automatically merge multiple
  tasks into a single task. An example implementation shows fused tasks take
  14-90% less time than running the tasks individually.
