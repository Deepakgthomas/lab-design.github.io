title: The Role of Aspects in Modeling Product Line Variabilities
abstract: >
  As of today, it is unclear whether aspect-oriented modeling can benefit the
  model-driven development of software product lines. Although some preliminary
  studies exist at the requirements and implementation level that investigate
  the interaction of crosscutting behaviors and product-line variabilities, to
  the best of our knowledge these interactions at the modeling level are not yet
  investigated. The contribution of this work is a preliminary study of the
  object-oriented and aspect-oriented approaches for handling crosscutting
  variabilities. This study helps us identify desired characteristics of
  aspect-oriented modeling techniques for product lines. A pacemaker product
  line, extracted from the real industry case, serves as a running example to
  illustrate our findings.
