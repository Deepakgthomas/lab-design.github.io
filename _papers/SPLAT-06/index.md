title: Preserving Separation of Concerns through Compilation
abstract: >
  Today’s aspect-oriented programming (AOP) languages provide software engineers
  with new possibilities for keeping conceptual concerns separate at the source
  code level. For a number of reasons, aspect weavers sacriﬁce this separation
  in transforming source to object code (and thus the very term weaving). In
  this paper, we argue that sacriﬁcing modularity has signiﬁcant costs,
  especially in terms of the speed of incremental compilation and in testing. We
  argue that design modularity can be preserved through the mapping to object
  code, and that preserving it can have signiﬁcant beneﬁts in these dimensions.
  We present and evaluate a mechanism for preserving design modularity in object
  code, showing that doing so has potentially signiﬁcant benefits.
