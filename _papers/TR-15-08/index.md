title: "Boa: Ultra-Large-Scale Software Repository and Source-Code Mining"
abstract: >
  In todayâ€™s software-centric world, ultra-large-scale software repositories,
  e.g. SourceForge, GitHub, and Google Code, are the new library of Alexandria.
  They contain an enormous corpus of software and related information.
  Scientists and engineers alike are interested in analyzing this wealth of
  information. However, systematic extraction and analysis of relevant data from
  these repositories for testing hypotheses is hard, and best left for mining
  software repository (MSR) experts! Specifically, mining source code yields
  significant insights into software development artifacts and processes.
  Unfortunately, mining source code at a large-scale remains a difficult task.
  Previous approaches had to either limit the scope of the projects studied,
  limit the scope of the mining task to be more coarse-grained, or sacrifice
  studying the history of the code. In this paper we address mining source code:
  a) at a very large scale; b) at a fine-grained level of detail; and c) with
  full history information. To address these challenges, we present
  domain-specific language features for source code mining in our language and
  infrastructure called Boa. The goal of Boa is to ease testing MSR-related
  hypotheses. Our evaluation demonstrates that Boa substantially reduces
  programming efforts, thus lowering the barrier to entry. We also show drastic
  improvements in scalability.
