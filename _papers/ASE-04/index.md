title: Understanding Aspects via Implicit Invocation
abstract: >
  Aspect-oriented (AO) design and programming methods promise to improve the
  modularity properties of software-intensive systems. However, AO is also seen
  as violating fundamental design principles; and we lack a theory to guide its
  appropriate use. Our work rests on the idea that successful AO techniques have
  deep roots in implicit invocation (II) mechanisms. Elaborating this connection
  provides for an expedited development of both a theoretical understanding and
  an effective practice of AO design techniques. In this paper we show, in
  particular, that this bridge can be exploited to enable model checking of AO
  systems using existing techniques for II systems.
