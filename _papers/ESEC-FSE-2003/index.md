title: "Eos: Instance-Level Aspects for Integrated System Design"
abstract: >
  This paper makes two contributions: a generalization of AspectJ-like languages
  with first-class aspect instances and instance-level advising, and a mapping
  of the mediator style for integrated system design into this space. We present
  Eos as a prototype language design and implementation. It extends C# with
  AspectJ-like constructs, first-class aspect instances and instance-level
  advising. These features enable a direct mapping of mediators to aspect
  instances, with modularity improved, insofar as components need not declare,
  announce, or register for events.
