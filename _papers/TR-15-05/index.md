title: "Duck Futures: A Generative Approach to Transparent Futures"
abstract: >
  Futures offer a convenient abstraction for encapsulating delayed computation.
  It is a mechanism to introduce concurrency through a rewrite of the sequential
  program. However, managing futures is tedious and requires knowledge of
  concurrency and its concerns. The notion of transparent futures is used to
  hide the complexity of futures from developers. A number of techniques based
  on transparency have been proposed to create and manage futures. Previous
  techniques make use of reflection. In this paper, we propose duck futures that
  use a generative approach. We show that duck futures are much more efficient
  compared to previous notions of transparent futures. We also present the first
  large scale study of the applicability and utility of duck futures in practice
  using the Boa infrastructure for mining large scale open source repositories.
  Our study finds that transparent futures, despite their limitations, can be
  very useful in practice.
