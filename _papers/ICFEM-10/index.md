title: Automating Cut-off for Multi-parameterized Systems
abstract: >
  Verifying that a parameterized system satisfies certain desired properties
  amounts to verifying an infinite family of the system instances. This problem
  is undecidable in general, and as such a number of sound and incomplete
  techniques have been proposed to address it. Existing techniques typically
  focus on parameterized systems with a single parameter, (i.e., on systems
  where the number of processes of exactly one type is dependent on the
  parameter); however, many systems in practice are multi-parameterized, where
  multiple parameters are used to specify the number of different types of
  processes in the system. In this work, we present an automatic verification
  technique for multi-parameterized systems, prove its soundness and show that
  it can be applied to systems irrespective of their communication topology. We
  present a prototype realization of our technique in our tool Golok, and
  demonstrate its practical applicability using a number of multi-parameterized
  systems.
