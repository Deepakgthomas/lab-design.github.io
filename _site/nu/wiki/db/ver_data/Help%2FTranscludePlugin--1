pages within a wiki page.

! Plugin Arguments

=src= |
  The URL of the page to transclude
=height= |
  The (initial) height of the transclusion frame.
  If, possible, after the transcluded page is loaded,
  the frame is resized via javascript so that it
  fits the entire transcluded page.  (See below for more.)

! Bugs / Caveats

o Pages are transcluded using =<iframe>= tags.  Older browsers do not
  support ''iframe''s.  In that case the user will be presented with a
  link to the trancluded material.

o When possible, JavaScript code is used to adjust the height of the
  _iframe_ so that it fits the entire transcluded page.
  Unfortunately, this seems possible only when the transcluded page
  comes from the same server as the wiki page.  (This restriction is
  due to security checks built in to the JavaScript language.)

o The recursion detection code does not currently work.  Be careful to
  avoid recursive transclusions, or you'll be sorry (or at least
  amused.)

! Example

<verbatim>
<?plugin Transclude src="http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/demo/ChangeLog" ?>
</verbatim>

will get you

<?plugin Transclude src="http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/demo/ChangeLog" ?>";}
