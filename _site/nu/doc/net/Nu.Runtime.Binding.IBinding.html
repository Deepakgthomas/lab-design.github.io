      <p> The interface for every binding. A Binding does two things: 1. It uses a pointcut to select join points in the program. 2. It associates a set of methods, Handlers, to be executed at those join points. There are two type of bindings: static and non-static If you put a modifier static before binding declaration it becomes a static binding. For example: static binding bd; Otherwise it is a non-static binding. A static binding is a compile-time binding and a non-static binding is a run-time binding. A static binding will make sure that the handlers are always invoked at the join points selected by the binding. A non-static binding will not automatically associate the set of methods to the join points. It will wait for you till runtime to bind an object. If you bind an object at runtime, the binding will associate the handlers with all join points of that particular object. This object is called subject of the binding. </p>
