## News

- We are looking for PhD students and Postdoctoral fellows to join the Panini
  and the Boa project. Send resume to [Dr. Hridesh Rajan](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/).
  Both projects have a global user base.
- [Boa](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu) project receives a new NSF grant to further
  enhance Boa's capabilities to help with studies related to software and its
  evolution at a large scale.
- Panini project receives a new [NSF grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1423370)
  to further develop capsule-oriented programming.
- User accounts for Boa demonstrated at ICSE 2014 and ICSE 2013 can be requested
  here.
- We just released 0.9.3 version of Panini language with new features and better
  analyses for concurrency correctness. See http://paninij.org.


## About

The laboratory for software design at Iowa State University conducts research in
programming languages, compilers and software engineering. Our overarching goal
is to develop tools and techniques that enable better design of software
intensive systems: a better design that is easier and cheaper to implement,
verify and sustain and that is more portable across computing platform
differences.

Our two leading projects are Panini that aims to enable safe and efficient
concurrent programming by construction, and Boa that is a domain-specific
language and an infrastructure for mining software repositories.

Our research meetings are in 216 Atanasoff Hall on Wednesdays from 9a.m.-1p.m.
